# Introduction

Welcome to headless-charts, a modern, flexible, and customizable charting library built for developers who value design freedom and consistency.

## Why did we build headless-charts?

There are many terrific graphics libraries out there eg: [Observable plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery). Why build another?

We wanted to build something

- which behaves purely 'headless'ly like [headless-ui](https://headlessui.com) (styles are not pre-built and can be customised as per your design language)
- which implements charts as well and try to cover as many charts from [FT-interactive Visual Vocabulary](http://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/) as possible
- which implements behaviour consistently (animations, tooltips, dark mode etc.)
- which is well documented
- which takes [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) styles as arguments and are easy to integrate within existing pages built with TailwindCSS.

## Key Features

- **Headless by Design**: Complete control over styling and appearance
- **Comprehensive Chart Types**: Extensive coverage of visualization types from the FT Visual Vocabulary
- **Consistent Behavior**: Unified experience across all chart types with standardized animations, tooltips, and dark mode support
- **TailwindCSS Integration**: Seamless integration with TailwindCSS projects
- **D3.js Powered**: Built on the robust foundation of [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for reliable and performant visualizations
- **Developer-Friendly**: Well-documented with clear examples and TypeScript support
